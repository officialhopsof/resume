Worked across a majority of Messaging teams,
a previously non-Messaging Candidate
Connection team, and some Horizon teams to
staff and execute on the following projects
when we otherwise did not have enough staff
on our team to do so. This bullet is the main
reason I gave myself exceptional as our team
was able to accomplish 3 or 4x as many things
as we otherwise could have due to my effort
here.

This cycle I have made headway toward
broadening iterative development practices. I
have also guided the team to deliver projects
independently and mostly within time projections.
My team had above average voice results and
appear to be happier than other teams in
Messaging and more broadly at indeed. I coached
members of my team, and as a result Yuanyuan is
able to operate and lead an entirely independent
team when given a project (timelineui, project
horizon, cerberus migration, convo alias). As a
manager my main goal is to make my team
successful, and while there is a lot of luck
involved in having the right people, my perception
is that my team is very successful.

space they need to make things better.
Examples: I empowered Ankit to pursue
publishing some code quality guidelines, I
push for 20% refactoring time for all work
that gets done. Next steps here would be to
figure out how to quantify this.
Proposed and got buy in from the team on
our contrib process. For Indeed, it is
uncharacteristically open and has a focus on
empowering other teams while not requiring
too much attention from us.
Worked with many external teams to have
Xiaojie, Yuanyuan, Ankit, Anthony, and
Brennen help push forward other projects,
even when there was not a direct benefit to
our team for doing so. Some examples:
Project Horizon, Dremr, Conversation List,
Global Docked Messaging.
I have done my best to eliminate process for
my team.
I have been an active participant in the E2E
testing discussions and have made several
recommendations as to how to ensure
stability across messaging, while not
sacrificing velocity.

I have been successful in evaluating and
improving the performance of my team
totally independently.
Timeline UI and EMPMS have significant
external contributors ranging from
messaging features to notifications. This is
facilitated by the contrib process I worked to
set up as well as providing a technical
support network via explicit DFR expectation
setting.

Our team needs very little direction to be
successful and are able to distil complex
projects into actionable steps. One recent
example is the conversation alias work. I was
a primary driver in keeping the scope to a
bare minimum and pushed very hard to not
tie success to displacing Dremr. Instead we
are focusing our attention on offboarding a
specific capability that Dremr has.
I have a team of 8 that I am able to guide and
give direction to.

▪
This was one area of improvement I had last
cycle and I have implemented some small
changes that I think made a big difference. I
keep an updated roster of who is working on
what at any given time, and we talk about
this as a team any time it changes. In
addition, as a team we discuss any new
initiatives that crop up as well as their
impact.

During the P0 timeframe I was an advocate
for dividing up the work into more
manageable pieces despite it being more
effort on paper. While we can’t turn back the
clock, I do still feel strongly that we could
have moved faster if we had done that.
I advocated for not doing TEL, as while it may
have been in our long term interest, the
added complexity and coordination needed to
make that happen ultimately distracted from
the focus we had on P0. I made a calculated
recommendation to focus more on near term
results when it came to this project.
Both within and outside of my team I
continuously bring up the discussion of “Is
this this most important thing we can be
doing right now?”. I ask this question more
than I hear others asking it. This is an area I
have coached several members of my team on
specifically.
I was a vocal advocate of scoping down pretty
much every effort my team has had to date.
By keeping the focus tight, we were able to
achieve very low leads times.

technologies and implementations based on an
evaluation of trade-offs and capabilities. Create
tools/best practices/changes in process that have
an impact beyond a single complex project or
team.

I try to look at every MR my team makes and
chime in where it makes sense. I have put
processes in place to make it really hard to
do the wrong things. Some examples are:
Code Coverage minimums in MRs,
deliberating making time for engineers on
my team to improve code quality, building a
culture of dissent within my team so that we
can question everything.
While I try to empower the leads on my team
to make the technical decisions, I do usually
ask that a serious effort be made to explore
the alternatives. This means that when the
TimelineUI is proposed as a service, we are
able to drill down and find that it only needs
to be a library.
One recent example of empowering engineers
to make the decisions that impact how they
work while also ensuring that the right
things are being considered in that decision:

Looking at the rubric I think I can check off nearly
every line item for TDM4, but looking outside of there,
I think things I could stand to improve on are:
•
▪
My knowledge of our legacy systems (I still
have to ask Yuanyuan or Xiaojie for a lot of
input when requests come in).
▪
My ability to influence external teams -
though as time goes on I am having more
success, most notably in the interest I am
seeing in iterative development/continuous
delivery.
Things I think I do well
▪
Empowering members of my team to do their
job really well
▪
Distilling ambiguous problems into
something with shape
▪
Directing focus on my team toward the most
important things

My focus on artifact driven iterative
development. Example: I broadened up
the weekly IMS demos from just my team
to all of IMS specifically to push this
mindset at a grass roots level. Seeing
what other teams is working on is an
additional bonus thing, that should
improve collaboration across IMS. I
coupled this change with a push to post
MRs publicly and pushing my team to do
so at least once a day in order to push the
broader org more toward iterative
development. This has not yet been totally
actualized, but I will continue pushing on
this flywheel.
▪
Needs Improvement
▪Being more aware of the broader IMS
project. Example: I was asked if I knew
what was causing a delay in other P0

teams, and I had speculation, but nothing
concrete.

Strengths - This is probably my strongest
category.
▪
Brokered multiple team shares within
IMS. Examples: Interview Navigator came
to our team to help out for a time, worked
with ENTMSG to help them out by lending
Xiaojie to them, Identified Taylor as a
viable source to help JSMSG and worked
with both external teams to make that
happen.
▪
Pushed for and convinced my team that
iterative development, even when it
requires more work, was the best
approach to delivery; Coached(ing) my
team on breaking projects down to the
most important pieces and defining a true
MVP, we saw this with the recently active
project for example; coached(ing) my
team on when it makes sense to just
deploy to production and have a rollback
plan vs a slower ramp up using proctors
when the risk is low, an example of this is
the timeline ui components; pushed for
90%+ code coverage on our team, in the
timeline ui this has enabled us to move
quickly.
▪
Our primary P0 IMS goal of having all of
our components running in production
was something I drove. I didn't want
components sitting idle in a library and
not being exercised.
▪
Needs Improvement
▪
My efforts have largely been focused on
more grass roots organization. I could
approach things I want to solve from the
additional direction of top->down.

I have worked extensively with Yuanyuan
to help guide him into being a technical
leader on the team. He has went from a
SWE2-2 who had only delivered smaller
scoped projects to successfully leading
the entire Timeline UI project. He has
been able to learn to delegate (ex: was
struggling with being overwhelmed and
needed help), scope work, work externally
to find blockers (ex: I would work with
him to get him involved as broadly as
possible in all of the engineering
decisions), push for what the Timeline UI
needs when collaborating with other
teams (ex: TEL).

teams on migrating out of AUS data
center, and on a Dradis events exchange
migration.

Working with Interview Navigator team to
define and integrate with TEL.
▪

▪
I want to see Engineers have product
interviews, though we need to start hiring
again before this will be able to be
actualized.

Have not yet done any mentorship outside
of my team, outside of offering a few tips/
resources to a new manager (Jibin).

I have worked with several teams to
coordinate the IMS work. This includes
▪
Drove consensus for other
teams (ENTMSG and JSMSG and IN)
to take ownership over a specific
body of work we needed to
accomplish in the early days of IMS.
▪
Worked with IN to sell, hand off, and
define the TEL.
▪
Our team's IMS work is largely on
schedule.
▪Helped to identify and drive
mitigations for blockers across IMS.
Examples: the interplay between the
▪
timeline ui and the conversation list,
building a strategy for not having
GQL endpoints available during
development, coordinated with
JSMSG to deliver a timeline ui that
works for both JS and Emp, worked
with ENTMSG to ensure they had the
expertise they needed to execute on
the conversation list and the GQL
api.
▪
Needs Improvement
▪
Push harder on things I believe are the
best approach, examples: not needing the
DSL; scope, scale, and complexity of the
DSL; IMS team structures; not spending 2
quarters building infra and not delivering
value.

Strengths

I pushed for my team to deliver code into
production in a continuous manner, even
if it meant more work. I view this move as
one of the main reasons we are making
progress as quickly as we are.
▪
I have pushed for delivering value earlier
and often with specific suggestions across
IMS. Examples: for the DSL, I suggested
we start with a small library that would
just be imported into the build
environment for other projects. This
would have given us short term gain but
left the door open for expansion in the
long term if/when it was needed.
▪
I have given guidance on multiple
occasions to refocus on the highest
priority thing, examples: recently online
indicator was taking longer than expected
and I worked with PM to timebox and end
the effort in order to refocus on IMS; We
received additional work from other teams
(aus shut down among others) and I led
the triage on my team to stay focused on
IMS and tackle them post P0.
▪
Needs Improvement
▪My team could have a better
understanding of what is going on outside
of it, Example: Working on, but have not
▪
yet actualized, a more broad, high level
progress report at a level that ICs would
care about.
I have a lot of ideas that I think could
push this score higher, but I could do a
better job of convincing others to see the
value in them. Basically, I feel that my
scope of influence here has largely just
been my immediate team, and not
expanded more broadly. I do think some of
the things I am doing need to have small
success first, so that I can point to
evidence that they are successful, so I do
expect this score to rise over the next
year.

Pushed for very high test coverage and
improvement on the process: https://
indeed-pte.slack.com/archives/
C04D2KRMA4C/p1674510901018149 - I
also convinced my team to adopt a 90%
test coverage minimum. Pushed for a
change of testing framework from RTL to
RTR in order to have more confidence in
our unit test results (was not successful in
making this change however).
▪
I worked with and convinced my team to
take on some additional steps to mock
endpoints and set up localization in a way
that would could deliver the Timeline UI
into production now and not be blocked
by these dependencies, but can still go
back and implement them in the correct
way later.
▪
Needs Improvement
▪
Continue pushing on getting everyone in
IMS to be iterative first when they are
building products. This is going to take
some time as there is a lot of momentum
toward large development cycles.
▪At at technical level I feel that my skills
are really high, but finding the
opportunity to demonstrate that has been
challenging (I do think this is something a
lot of manager struggle with), especially
•
since my experience is more broad than it
is deep.
