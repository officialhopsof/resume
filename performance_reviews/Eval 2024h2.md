Comment: TAKE/SAN Compliance (PerPartyMetadata, IndeedPlus, Glassdoor) https://indeed.atlassian.net/browse/SMBMSG-1319, https://indeed.atlassian.net/browse/EMRELP-1040, https://indeed.atlassian.net/browse/SMBMSG-1441
• What: Accomplished TAKE/SAN compliance for 3 workflows. Each of them was long-lasting issues
within the DREMR system.
• How:
• Independently guided the team to finish audit and implementation.
• (+) Guided the team to conduct user testing (https://indeed.atlassian.net/browse/SMBMSG-1323) for Glassdoor workflow, which required close
collaboration with multiple teams (Glassdoor, Indeed apply, JSBE).
• Documented the “How-to” to test Glassdoor workflow.

DREMR Central GEODES compliance
• Met with Data Access and Governance team (https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tNRk_dpJM-Z6Ayviacz_o--FY7OBgmF3tI1wWanp44U/edit?usp=sharing) to discuss Dremr Central and Conversation Central
compliance.
• Took an action item to re-up access on a quarterly basis.
• Manual message delete post de-couple
• [In progress] Met with IT to discuss automating that process.
Conversation Central Needs for GEODeS
• Explored that Litigation Hold work could be leveraged to power displaying Conversation Aliased
Messages in Conversation Central. (https://indeed.atlassian.net/browse/SMBMSG-1444, https://indeed.atlassian.net/browse/COMMSHUB-303)
• Shared knowledge with Flow team

Missing Locale for DREMR Messages
• What:
• Drove data gathering to help support triage, understanding, and overall impact analysis.
Through this we now know that we have moved the needle from 89% Locale resolution to
94%, and will have another 1% soon. (https://docs.google.com/document/d/11E7U2rjvi2kFbE2QeIu2jsZfGBwQdSE89pG4Wo92VEc/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.fj9827wvkkie)
• Ex: Comments from and IQL queries throughout Locale Issue design doc
• How:
• Championed prioritization and definition (https://indeed.atlassian.net/browse/DRAGON-77) of fixing Indeed Plus Locale support due to the impact
it had both from a user perspective and legally.
• Drove precise requirements from Legal by clarifying use cases
• (+) Worked (https://indeed.atlassian.net/browse/LPR-11074?focusedCommentId=13828480) with Legal to understand the urgency and prioritize the efforts
• Hosted x-team syncs with CommsPlat and senior leadership to align on objectives and scope.

[CORGI] PigIndex to Spark Migration (https://indeed.atlassian.net/browse/DRAGON-73)
• Set expectations to break PigIndex work down into manageable deliverables/milestones that
ultimately led to successful completion of the project.
• Reviewed and worked with engineers on refining these deliverables/milestones (example 1, 2).

Other CORGI work
• What: 64bit Account Id Migration (https://indeed.atlassian.net/browse/SMBMSG-1446), DREMR MongoDB Atlas migration to v6 (https://indeed.atlassian.net/browse/SMBMSG-1254), ELDARG Migration (https://indeed.atlassian.net/browse/DRAGON-158),
HOBO to Docker-Compose (https://indeed.atlassian.net/browse/DRAGON-80), Cross-region backup for all MongoDB Atlas Clusters (https://indeed.atlassian.net/browse/SMBMSG-1549), Unicode
Support.
• How:
• Proactively reviewed CORGI work and independently scoped them by working with CORGI
owners (https://indeed-pte.slack.com/archives/C01GC445HHB/p1734980211182929).
• Prioritized CORGI work to ensure work being done on time.

Q1 Planning
• Contributed to technical discovery and estimation work (Read/Unread for I+, CAPM India Launch)

Operational
• EVNT-6187
• Was the primary POC for initial stages over the Thanksgiving.
• Sent out communications
• Coordinated the efforts to restored the production (example)
• Prioritized and resolved post-retro follow up items

Coaching
• Managerial Behaviors Composite Score: 100%
• DEIB+ Composite Score: 100%
• People who reported to Brandon highlighted the following:
• Valued team well-being, celebrated achievements, and created a positive work environment.
• Kept the team aligned, adapted to changes, and ensured important tasks were completed.
• Expressed the need for Brandon to be more hands-on, such as reviewing product and
operational health metrics to elevate the system robustness.

(+) Hiring
• What: Interviewed 13 and hired 3 contractors by the end of Feb.
• How
• Despite a slow start due to low quality of pipeline, worked with the Outpost team to get the
hiring progress back on track without sacrificing the bar.
• Set up a meeting with Outpost on process and candidate quality improvements. Anecdotally
saw quality increase after this and did successfully meet hiring goals.
• Set up an internal interview process to include a technical round led by our tech lead and
shadowed by a senior engineer.
Process Improvements
• Streamlined team processes to utilize a single Jira Project down from ~17 (Ex: One of the projects
we closed)
• Moved to a self service model for Conversation Central and Dremr Central access.
• Proactively aligned work priorities with PM and Messaging LT on regular basis.
• Encouraged reports to demo accomplishments (example 1, 2)

Rubric Dimensions + Evidence
• Ownership
• Specifically defined and pulled in DREMR Observability as a SteadyState tangential initiative
in order to ensure we can better understand when and how the service is failing.
• Streamlined team processes to utilize a single Jira Project down from ~17 (Ex: One of the
projects we closed), as well as moved to a self service model for Conversation Central and
Dremr Central access.
• Engaged with other teams to align on objectives and ownership where it made the most sense.
• Ex: Conversation Service ownership and GEODES feature additions (private channel)
• Pushed to deprioritize our Shield test migration in favor of redefining our e2e tests from the
ground up. The current tests are low value and highly mocked. Can mostly be moved to a
mixture of Unit testing and higher fidelity semantic testing.
• Tangential Evidence (private channel)
• Met with Data Access and Governance team to discuss Dremr Central and Conversation
Central compliance. Took an action item to re-up access on a quarterly basis. Met with IT to
discuss automating that process. Waiting to hear back from IT on if this is now possible.
• Identified the need to bring in help and worked with CommsPlat to confirm their Litigation Hold
work could be leveraged to power displaying Conversation Aliased Messages in Conversation
Central. Later, worked with FLOW to hand off this work as well as the knowledge of powering
it through the Litigation Hold service.
• Organizational Impact
• Frequently worked across teams to ensure CORGIs, Project work, and Engineer growth was
accomplished
• Ex: Enable X-Region backup for MongoDB Atlas Clusters
• Ex: Mentorship (private channel)
• Ex: Email Inbox System (private conversation)
• Ex: Take/San Glassdoor (private conversation)
• Set up a meeting (private channel) with the contractor sourcing group (Outpost) on process
and candidate quality improvements. Anecdotally saw quality increase after this and did
successfully meet hiring goals.
• Interviewed 13 and Hired 3 contractors, set up an internal interview process to include a
technical round led by our tech lead and shadowed by a senior engineer. Met end-of-feb hiring
goal without sacrificing on candidate quality.
• Independence and Scope
• Worked with PM and Messaging LT on many occasions to align on priorities - critical due to
how small the team is.
• Ex: Most weeks in our Check-In
• Helped keep my team focused and on tasks as can be seen by my 558 jira comments and
126 reported tickets. Source: Hindsight.
• Utilized MBR demos to have engineers demonstrate project progress
• Ex: Take/San for I+
• Ex: IMS Notification Migration
• Conducted monthly hindsight check ins, set specific metric and delivery goals with everyone
on the team. Ensured director alignment on deliverables. Ex: 1-1 Notes Nov 14th
• Was primary POC for initial stages of EVNT-6187 over the Thanksgiving Holiday. This
included sending out communications, tracking and updating action items, and coordinating
work to mitigate and correct the failure.
• Prioritized quality work where appropriate such as
• Ex: updating stale Applications/Libraries (1 of many tickets)
• Business Alignment
• Worked directly with TPM on defining new PPP layout and timeline visualization
• Built visualizations for capacity planning and project timelines/estimations in order to make
reporting easier and more accurate.
• Championed prioritization and definition of fixing Indeed Plus Locale support due to the impact
it had both from a user perspective and legally. Hosted x-team syncs with CommsPlat and
senior leadership to align on objectives and scope. Handed off the retrospective and final
communications to Grant Heimbach (PM) due to my child being born.
• Engaged directly with Legal on multiple occasions to understand impact so we could make a
decision on long vs short term investment.
• Ex. Tip/Blobby/VirusScan
• Ex. Questions related to user locale parsing
• Ex. Multiple JS got backfilled into the same conversation
• Skills
• Set expectations to break PigIndex work down into manageable deliverables/milestones that
ultimately led to successful completion of the project. Reviewed and worked with engineers on
refining these deliverables/milestones.
• Ex: dremrelay
• Ex: dremmsg
• Directly handled technical discovery and estimation work when engineers were busy with
other projects.
• Ex: Read/Unread for I+ (private conversation)
• Ex: CAPM India Launch
• Drove data gathering to help support triage, understanding, and overall impact analysis.
Through this we now know that we have moved the needle from 89% Locale resolution to
94%, and will have another 1% soon.
