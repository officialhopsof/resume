Tilt's Core Values
1. Own it
Leadership happens at every level.
2. Impact > activity
Busyness isn't a badge of honor. We measure what tilts the scales.
3. No risk, no real reward
When others fear bold moves, we see value in taking the swing.
These values reflect Tilt's culture of empowerment, results-oriented thinking, and willingness to take calculated risks to transform the credit industry. The company emphasizes that great work can happen anywhere (they operate across 14 countries and 12 time zones), maintains a low-meeting culture focused on data-driven recommendations, and recognizes impact over rigid promotion timelines.
