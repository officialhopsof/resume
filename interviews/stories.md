- DB Schema Upgrade - Early in ramp for new email relay, were utilizing 2 Mongo DB Schemas, could reduce complexity by upgrading everyone to V2, much easier to upgrade everyone early than wait until later, PM and Director didn’t want to do this upgrade, I had my lead engineer spend a few hours and come up with a proposal for what needed to be done and why, we whittled it down together to just the absolute minimum to bypass the tech debt, got buy in from PM, went to Director and got buy in. ~2 weeks of work

- Low Performer - AJ; Context: I do weekly demos in my teams, get suspicious when things take more than a few days/week; Engineer came to my team in a reorg, was not delivering substantial demos after a few weeks of onboarding,  we discussed in 1-1 and they were struggling with motivation after the layoffs/reorg, I set them up with a buddy for the next few weeks and checked in with both of them, the engineer still struggled to deliver demos and their Merges were low, I let them know about Indeed’s options for temporary leave if they needed it and set specific code delivery goals, when the engineer failed to consistently meet those goals I reached out to HR to begin the PIP process, upon receiving the PIP which comes with a severance option the engineer opted to take the Severance.

- Why Meta? - Meta works on some of the hardest and coolest problems in the world, only a handful of companies operate at the same scale, I’ve been a user of the products for years. I also align with the move fast and be bold culture

- Conflict - Shane and External Team; they wanted to convert a component we owned to a more modern version (rich text edit component for messaging), this was on our roadmap to do eventually but was welcoming the help if another team wanted to tackle it first so that they could add new templating features into the message service, we decided to help and I assigned an engineer to jump in and help them, the other engineer working on it had a very curt style of communication in slack that bothered the engineer on my team, during 1-1 he raised the concern that the other wasn’t being helpful and was being dismissive, we sat down and looked at the messages together and I reminded them to be charitable with people and that we all have the same goal, I then set up a meeting with the 3 of us so that we could discuss what needed to be done together, and my engineer felt better after that interaction. 

- Conflict - Choosing a testing framework; we were working on a new email relay and needed to pick a testing framework (Selinum vs Cypress), the engineer assigned chose Cypress in the design doc, the other engineering lead on my team said we should use Selimum, I set up a design review and we reviewed the pros and cons together as a whole team and ultimately settled on Selenium due to its internal support.
