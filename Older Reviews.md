comment:
Brandon’s team had exceptional output over the
past quarter, leading a major work stream for
GEODeS and driving most of our Horizon work for
Messaging. Both initiatives had aggressive
timelines. Without Brandon actively leading,
focusing, re-prioritizing, and shuffling work
assignments throughout the quarter, we would not
have been able to achieve our goals with either of
these efforts.
To accomplish these goals, Brandon worked across
a majority of Messaging teams and some Horizon
teams to staff and execute on projects that needed
staffing beyond his direct team. He helped pivot a
new team to Messaging, putting them to work on
key initiatives like AI suggested messaging for
Horizon, while providing oversight and guidance to
help the team onboard to the space.
Highlights

▪
▪
▪
Effectively collaborated with teams across
Messaging, Candidate Connection, and
Horizon, significantly boosting the team's
capacity to deliver on key projects: Horizon
M2, GEODES M0 and M1, and required work
including the Java 18 upgrade, Jenkins to
GitLab CI migration, and the 64bit account ID
migration.
Spearheaded scope definition and reduction
for Horizon M2, focusing on candidate ranking,
basic messaging, and AI messaging, which
helped keep the work focused and on track.
Advocated for the incremental delivery of the
Conversation Alias feature, resulting in stable
releases that met initial project objectives.
Demonstrated leadership in identifying and
staffing the development of a fallback plan for
Conversation Alias M1, underlining his
proactive approach to project management.
Played a pivotal role in coaching and
advancing team members' careers, notably
contributing to Yuanyuan's promotion after
nearly two years of mentorship.
Initiated and expedited the establishment of a
Messaging triage and support process,
improving our ability to handle inbound
customer complaints and identify and fix issues
faster.
Justification for exceptional What: juggling
Horizon, Conversation Alias, and the main
repository of shared UI components for Messaging -
the sheer output of the team, across a diversity of
(sometimes competing) initiatives.
Brandon has a lot on his plate, and its
clear he has taken on a lot of next-level
ownership, especially with Horizon work.

Messaging group)

comment:
Brandon has a unique leadership style, which has
proven effective on his team. He conducts relatively
few recurring meetings (no daily stand ups, for
example), minimizes process overhead, gives his
team a lot of freedom and autonomy, and is
obsessive about iterative delivery, decreasing scope
to the bare minimum to achieve low lead times.
He has guided his team to deliver projects
independently and mostly within time projections,
and his engineers are quite happy working with
him. His engineers operate with autonomy and he
encourages them to demonstrate leadership, which
I believe accounts for much of their output and job
satisfaction.

Career progression
▪

▪
▪
Consistency at next level - Brandon joined
Indeed with prior experience as an engineering
manager at multiple other companies. In my
opinion, he was already at least half way
through level to TDM4 when hired and has
been consistently at next level for the past 6–9
months.
Direct scope - Brandon built the first
Messaging team in Employer from scratch in
2022, hiring and onboarding engineers that
have proven to be among our strongest
contributors. In the first reorg last year,
Brandon took on two additional engineers and
a UX Dev, growing his team to 8 ICs.
Scope through influence - Over the past 18
months, Brandon has steadily increased his
leadership and influence to extend well beyond
his team. He has been a major influence on the
entire messaging domain toward iterative
development. He also shifted our culture
toward cross-team and cross-functional demos
of code, docs, designs, and other deliverables—
creating what has become our weekly Show &
Tell for the bridge team. Finally, he has taken
on a leadership role among the 6 messaging
TDMs across Employer and Job Seeker, leading
a regular sync and helping to coordinate load
balancing of engineers across teams.
High value work - Brandon's team is
currently leading one of the two major
initiatives for our Get Email Out of the Driver's
Seat (GEODeS) initiative: Conversation Alias.
Additionally, his team is leading our efforts to
integrate messaging with [[Project Horizon]].
Finally, he has coached two of his tech leads to
take on TLA roles that span multiple teams.
Both are performing beyond their level and one
has received Transformation the past two
cycles as a result of Brandon’s coaching and
empowerment.

value:
You have clearly demonstrated strengths in setting
clear expectations, empowering your team for
meaningful work, and unblocking them to get that
work done. Your unique leadership style, which
emphasizes autonomy and minimizes routine
meetings, has been well-received by your current
team members, and the team has been quite
successful and productive as a result. Everyone
reporting to you seems to really appreciate your
leadership.
However, reflecting on the feedback from AJ’s
recent departure, it's evident that fostering deeper
connections within the team could further elevate
your leadership. The exit interview I had with him
highlighted a critical insight: while your approach
effectively supports individual contributions, it may
overlook the essential element of team cohesion.
AJ’s sense of isolation and difficulty in grasping the
collective team efforts underscores a gap between
operational efficiency and team unity. There may be
an opportunity here for you to enhance your
leadership by integrating strategies that promote a
stronger team bond and a shared sense of purpose.
I encourage you to explore ways to build more
connection and understanding within your team.
Here are a few ideas:
▪
Regular Informal Check-Ins: Beyond the
scope of project updates, encourage informal
gatherings—virtual or in-person—that allow
team members to share not just work updates
but personal insights and interests. This can
foster a sense of community and belonging. For
instance, whether on Slack or Zoom, you could
prompt the team to share photos and stories of
the eclipse (since we’ll all be able to see it,
even if we aren’t in the main path), or have
them give virtual tours of their broader
workspace, picking up their laptops and
showing the team around - since they probably
only ever see each other seated from the same
camera perspective. Get creative about ways to
pull the team out of their work and build
connection.
▪Transparent Communication: Strengthening
the visibility of individual and team
contributions towards the broader goals can
•
▪
help in building a unified vision. You might
introduce a more structured format in your
weekly meetings where team members share
their progress and personal learnings, not just
technical learnings or things they are working
on. Leading by example here, and taking the
first step in vulnerability can go a long way.
Empathetic Leadership Practices:
Encouraging open dialogues about work-life
balance, burnout, and mental health can create
a supportive environment where team
members feel valued not just for their work
output but as individuals.
As you continue to lead with a focus on empowering
individual contributions, adding these layers of
connection and empathy can not only address the
gaps identified but also enrich the team's overall
performance and satisfaction.
I want to encourage you that your current
leadership style is quite effective. Rather than
attempting to change the way you operate, think of
this as augmenting it with additional layers of
connection. Done well, it can not only help the team
feel better connected and supported, it can also
enhance their productivity and output.

Brandon's team is leading one of the major
projects that make up our Get Email Out of the
Driver's Seat (GEODeS) initiative:
Conversation Alias.
When aligning toward our goal of getting 2/3 of
legacy DREMR traffic migrated off of DREMR,

this project was the most at risk to block the
schedule for the broader project, which spans
multiple teams across Job Seeker and
Employer.
Brandon took action to re-focus the team,
shuffle priorities and existing work, and even
personally took on the team's DFR
responsibilities for a good chunk of the quarter
to allow his engineers to be 100% focused on
the work.
As a result this project is currently at green
status
I'm scoring the How as exceptional and the What as
strong, since the actual output here is still
unproven. We are working to launch the new
systems this quarter (which comes with all the
usual risks of rollout and integration unknowns),
but the work to get us where we are today has been
exceptional.

Brandon has a unique leadership style, which has
proven effective on his team. He conducts relatively
few recurring meetings (no daily stand ups, for
example), minimizes process overhead, gives his
team a lot of freedom and autonomy, and is
obsessive about iterative delivery, decreasing scope
to the bare minimum to achieve low lead times. This
has enabled his team to pivot quickly while
delivering a steady stream of value including shared
timeline components, improvements to
attachments, migrating employer messaging
services to AWS, messaging FBEs, and multi-
recipient fixes.
He has guided his team to deliver projects
independently and mostly within time projections,
and his engineers are quite happy working with
him. He hired most of his team last year, and has
built one of the strongest teams I’ve seen at Indeed
when it comes to independence and delivery. His
engineers operate with autonomy and he
encourages them to demonstrate leadership, which
I believe accounts for much of their output and job
satisfaction.
Highlights
▪Influence across messaging - Brandon’s
influence toward iterative development has
had an impact on both TDM and PM leaders
across the messaging bridge team. When we
needed a leader to drive our evolution away
from legacy DREMR aliases to the new
◦ ▪
▪
▪
▪
Conversation Alias system, the consensus from
the steering committee was that we wanted to
do this iteratively and that Brandon was the
clear pick to lead this effort successfully.
Brandon also created our “Show and Tell”
format, which started as his team’s demo day
and expanded to include all six teams across
GMs with presentations from engineering, UX,
product, and even clients teams. The engineers
from Brandon’s team continue to lead this
meeting today.
Coaching and leadership through
significant organizational changes. As the
only fully-formed messaging team in Employer
before the reorg, Brandon’s played a large role
in onboarding many new engineers to the
space. He also onboarded several new SWEs to
his team through the reorg. We’ve had several
pivots in our prioritization for messaging as
we’ve uncovered issues in our legacy systems
that need work, and through all of this change,
Brandon’s engineers have been engaged and
reported high levels of satisfaction with both
Brandon and Indeed. I attribute much of this to
the culture of trust and transparency he has
fostered as TDM and coach to his engineers.
Candid disagreement - Brandon has
demonstrated a willingness to speak the truth,
especially when he has a contrarian
perspective that no one else has voiced. Many
leaders might think in their heads "this doesn't
make sense" or "I actually think the opposite of
what you just said" but few have the courage to
say those things out loud or the diplomacy to
do so in a way that encourages people instead
of rubbing them the wrong way. Brandon has
challenged my decisions many times, but does
so in a way that feels respectful and helpful.
I’ve learned a lot from him as a result, and
shifted the way I view solving problems.
These highlights combine to give Brandon an
exceptional rating in the How dimension. His
approach is relatively unique and effective, and has
had a positive influence on the messaging space as
a whole.

Brandon is performing very close to my
expectations for a Sr. Manager at Indeed. There are
a couple areas where I would like to see him grow
to expand his leadership skills and close the gap to
TDM4:
▪
▪
More formal mentorship of other leaders.
Brandon has begun having an influence beyond
his immediate team, but I think he would
benefit from taking on one ore more less-
experienced TDMs as a practice ground for
eventually managing other managers as well as
a way to supplement his first-hand experience
with the second-hand experience of others as
he coaches them through challenging
leadership situations. There are several TDMs
that started managing within the last year,
many through our coach-in-training program
(Jibin is one of these, on the Job Seeker side of
messaging)—these could be a good place to
start. I am happy to help facilitate these
relationships. One goal for Brandon could be
attracting others to solicit mentorship based on
Brandon's reputation and their observation of
his leadership.
More intentional horizontal "peer-
mentorship" across messaging. Most of
Brandon's influence has been either downward
(to his direct reports) or upward (in providing
candid feedback and suggestions to messaging
leadership), but he has less interaction and
influence on the other team leads in
messaging, particularly those that report into
Job Seeker. Establishing deeper peer
relationships could help him extend his
influence while learning from others that may
see things differently than him. It would also
help him establish more breadth of
understanding across the entire messaging
space, enabling him to step up into bigger-
picture strategy and planning work outside of
his team.
•
Both of these are opportunities to more
intentionally expend his influence beyond his team
—and pick up some of the skills and experience he
might get managing a second team without having
to wait for that opportunity to open up after the
hiring freeze.
I also think there is opportunity to demonstrate next
level business alignment through the exercise we
are currently undertaking to re-align our messaging
teams around clear charters. I'm encouraging
Brandon to step up in informal leadership as we
hand off the work to flesh out charters and
interfaces between teams to our team leads.

comment:
With this being Brandon’s first full performance
cycle, it is clear that he has onboarded quickly and
is now delivering strong results. Most of Brandon’s
team is new (he hired them last year) and he has
quickly brought them up to speed as well.
Brandon lobbied for an iterative approach to
delivering the messaging work stream his team was
responsible for ( shared timeline UI components ).
Rather than reaching code complete on all modules
in February and ramping in March (as we had
originally planned), he led the team to iteratively
ramp pieces into production as early as January.
This iterative approach enabled the team to learn
quicker and I believe it contributed to their success
hitting this aggressive timeline. These timeline
components are now code complete and ramped to
100% in en_US.
▪
One Host Migration: led team to complete the
rollout of Inbox OH migration world-wide to
100%. This resulted in a 4X drop in page load
time improving the load performance.
▪
▪
▪
Shared messaging timeline UI components
▪
Duplication of effort across GM lines - the
same components will be used by JS and
EMP - they have been designed and built
in collaboration across GM lines.
▪
Reduced dependency on HTML email
content, increasing team velocity and
providing more autonomy for message
type owner teams for faster
experimentation going forward
Resolved 21 support issues to fix issues
reported through client support
The team provided support to the following
partner teams to help them deliver high quality
experiences
▪
HQM in adding features such as
attachment upload and triage
▪
▪
HQM team on Single thread addition
Employer safe/trust on typingDNA
integration
▪
First Conversations team on migrating the
ad-hoc interview to OG
▪
Enterprise candidate team on
ENTCAND-60
▪
Data Science team on candidate
connection set up their cron job for new

In his own words:
▪
Strengths
▪My focus on artifact driven
iterative development. Example:
I broadened up the weekly IMS
demos from just my team to all
of IMS specifically to push this
mindset at a grass roots level.
Seeing what other teams are
working on is an additional
bonus thing, that should
improve collaboration across
IMS. I coupled this change with
a push to post MRs publicly and
pushing my team to do so at
least once a day in order to push
the broader org more toward
iterative development. This has
not yet been totally actualized,
but I will continue pushing on
this flywheel.

broader IMS project. Example: I
was asked if I knew what was
causing a delay in other P0

but nothing concrete.
OWNERSHIP:
▪
value:
5.00
▪
comment:
Brandon has shown exceptional behaviors in the
area of ownership. He described this as “probably
my strongest category.” He has taken full
responsibility for the messaging P0 work, helped
create clear work streams across our 4 GMs to give
each team aggressive but achievable engineering
goals. He has also led the effort to implement cross-
GM processes like the weekly scrum of scums and
demo meetings, both of which have been
instrumental in getting all of our teams working
well together. He has influenced the way all of our
messaging teams operate, encouraging faster
delivery and responsible risk taking, which has
contributed to the success delivering P0 on an
aggressive timeline.
▪
▪
▪
Pushed cross-GM leaders to set a P0 IMS goal
of having 100% of components running in
production. This influenced the ultimate OKR
we set for all teams across GMs. Brandon’s
argument was that he didn’t want components
sitting idle in a library and not being exercised.
Brokered multiple team shares within IMS.
Examples: Interview Navigator came to our
team to help out for a time, worked with
ENTMSG to help them out by lending Xiaojie to
them, Identified Taylor as a viable source to
help JSMSG and worked with both external
teams to make that happen.
Pushed for and convinced the team that
iterative development, even when it requires
more work, was the best approach to delivery;
Coached team on breaking projects down to
the most important pieces and defining a true
MVP and assessing when it makes sense to just
deploy to production and have a rollback plan
▪
vs a slower ramp up using proctors when the
risk is low
▪
While working within aggressive timelines,
pushed the team for 90%+ code coverage in
the timeline ui, which has enabled more rapid
iteration over time.
ORGANIZATIONAL IMPACT:

value:

▪
comment:
Brandon has done an excellent job coaching the
members of his team and advising them on career
direction. He also led the hiring and onboarding
process for three new engineers, who are all
contributing at a high level today.
▪
▪
Worked extensively with Yuanyuan to help
guide him into being a technical leader on the
team. He went from a SWE2-2 who had only
delivered smaller scoped projects to
successfully leading the entire Timeline UI
project.
Led a “book report” on Shape Up as a project
management methodology - while we did not
directly implement this system, Brandon
helped isolate many of the key benefits, and his
presentation helped leaders across the GMs
get excited about more rapid iteration and
regular demos.
▪
From his team:
▪
“He created a questionnaire and
career path tracker doc for
better communication progress
as well as tracking our career
path. He tracked the answers to
those questions to make sure we
feel happy at work.”
▪
“He values my growth and
treats me with respect.”
▪
“I would say that Brandon is
among the best managers that I
have worked with in the years I
have worked in this industry.”
▪
“I believe his heavy emphasis on
weekly Demos lends itself to his
▪
▪
strategy of always aiming to
have deliverables for work
done.”
▪
“Brandon encourages me to take
full advantage of anything I
need to support an optimal work
environment, such as taking
time off to see family or
anything for my well-being.”
INDEPENDENCE and SCOPE:

comment:
Worked with several teams to coordinate the IMS
work. This includes:
▪
Drove consensus for other teams (ENTMSG
and JSMSG and IN) to take ownership over a
specific body of work we needed to accomplish
in the early days of IMS.
▪
Worked with Interview Navigator to sell, hand
off, and define the Timeline Entry Language
(DSL).
▪
Has led his team’s IMS work stream toward on
schedule delivery, despite aggressive timelines.
▪
Helped to identify and drive mitigations for
blockers across IMS. Examples: the interplay
between the timeline ui and the conversation
list, building a strategy for not having GQL
endpoints available during development,
coordinated with JSMSG to deliver a timeline
ui that works for both JS and Emp, worked
with ENTMSG to ensure they had the expertise
they needed to execute on the conversation list
and the GQL api.

comment:
▪
Pushed for team to deliver code into
production in a continuous manner, even if it
meant more work. I view this move as one of
the main reasons we are making progress as
quickly as we are.
▪Brandon has influenced teams across IMS to
deliver value earlier and often.
▪
▪
▪
Brandon has given guidance on multiple
occasions to refocus on the highest priority
thing, examples: recently online indicator was
taking longer than expected and he worked
with PM to timebox and end the effort in order
to refocus on IMS; We received additional work
from other teams (AUS shut down among
others) and he led the triage on his team to
stay focused on IMS and tackle them post P0.
I have seen Brandon leading his team
to take calculated risk to expedite
delivery of the initiative. For
example, pushing out timeline UI per
component and scoping changes that
really need to be A/B tested. This has
shown ability to balance risk and
results. - Jessica Lie (TDM4, JS

Pushed for very high test coverage and
improvement on the process - also convinced
his team to adopt a 90% test coverage
minimum.
▪
Worked with and convinced his team to take on
some additional steps to mock endpoints and
set up localization in a way that would deliver
the Timeline UI into production now and not be
blocked by these dependencies, but can still go
back and implement them in the correct way
later.
▪
He’s formed a strong partnership with his team
lead (Yuanyuan) and given him opportunity to
lead team meetings and drive the work. This
has contributed to the team’s success and
given Yuanyuan a chance to grow.
▪
He has set up easy and light weight
process…Everybody understands
what is being worked on and how it
impacts the over all IMS goal. I also
see him support and mold each
engineer into a specific mindset and
getting them to focus on their
strengths and make them take steps
towards their growth. - Karuna

Brandon has demonstrated a ton of leadership
ability. I believe he has the opportunity to be on a
relatively fast career track given his potential.
To grow toward L4, I would like to see the
following:
▪
▪
Begin taking a more active role in product/
strategy and execution leadership for the
broader messaging initiative (as opposed to his
individual team), contributing to strategy
memos, and taking on an informal leadership
role to drive our work beyond the team
Brandon directly manages.
I also think Brandon could begin mentoring
other TDMs and hosting workshops to share
his management approach. I have not seen a

practice, and this could be a good opportunity
for Brandon and Yuanyuan to document their
partnership for others to emulate.
▪
Finally, Brandon's leadership approach is
relatively unique. He gives a higher level of
autonomy and freedom to his SWEs than is
typical, even at a mostly bottoms-up place like
Indeed. He is getting great results with this
approach on his team. I would love to see
Brandon engage with other TDMs to explore
whether this approach could work on other
teams. Beginning a dialog on this topic in a
broader forum could help to shape the way
Brandon and other leaders at Indeed think, and
make a positive contribution to our overall
culture and leadership approach.

Negotiated the transfer of two SWEs from First
Conversation to Messaging team, ensuring
continuity of team (both engineers had worked
on the code base previously and were excited
to work on messaging again).

I've worked closely with
Brandon since he joined Indeed
in July. Our first collaboration
was to get me transitioned to
the new SMB messaging team.
Brandon spent time on talking
with me, getting to know my
preference and what I am
excited about in messaging. He
also described the future of the
new team, which was very
helpful for me to make my
decision to join the team. **–

comment:
▪
Began conversations around team scoping for
messaging, but still much to define with the
Enterprise team.
▪
Worked cross functionally/organizationally on a
Messaging strategy and technical vision
ultimately leading to broad organizational
alignment.
▪
Brandon joined the team a little
over 3 months ago and quickly
began to make an impact. He is
very good at communicating
which has been invaluable in
helping the team come prioritize
work. He also has a knack for
quickly understanding the scope
of work and sizing up potential
risks and issues. This has helped
us avoid potential problems
down the road. – Bruno

2/3 of the team is focusing on OH migration -
this was going to be the case even prior to the
SMB Candidates OH Tiger Team.
▪
Formed partnership with TF4 employer
advocate for messaging in ENT and assigned
remaining SWE as his shadow to help flesh out
designs for messaging platform.
▪
Worked with PM + Eng to make deliberate
decision to not prioritize OG migration due to
ground up messaging platform rebuild.

Guiding progress toward OH migration,
effectively focusing team and prioritizing the
work. Delivering on this work unblocks work
on the new Indeed Messaging System.
▪
Partnered with HQM to onboard two of their
SWEs to aid in and accelerate OH migration.

Note on Limited Impact
▪
Brandon has been in seat for less than half of
this six month review cycle. He joined Indeed
in June, had 3 weeks of family leave and a
couple weeks of PTO moving to a new house
(all of which was known and agreed to when he
joined Indeed).
▪
Brandon did not have a single engineer or
dedicated product counterpart on the team
until August. He spent his time prior to this
onboarding as a new hire, recruiting SWEs for
his team, and participating in the cross-GM
planning effort for the upcoming Indeed
Messaging System platform overhaul.

I think Brandon has an opportunity to take on
more of a leadership role as we move into
building P0 of the messaging platform. He
could meet regularly with engineering leaders
across GMs to help coordinate efforts and
ensure we are all moving in the same direction.
▪
Brandon also seems to have excellent
communication skills, but has not had much
opportunity to put them to work yet. With the
number of people involved in the messaging
initiative, and the number of new folks
onboarding to the space regularly, there is an
opportunity to collaborate with other leaders
to create diagrams, docs, and presentations
that help simplify and explain the work to new
and less-technical team members.
▪
Brandon has shared that his philosophies on
engineering leadership are "atypical" but I
think we can all benefit from a healthy debate
and examination of our leadership principles
and values. I'd encourage Brandon to find ways
to engage in the broader engineering
oraganization at Indeed on these topics, as
there is opportunity for significant
organizational impact in advancing new ideas
and mindsets around leadership.
