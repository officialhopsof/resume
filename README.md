# Resume

Convert markdown resumes to PDF format.

## Usage

```bash
./md2pdf.sh path/to/resume.md
```

The PDF will be created in the same directory as the markdown file.

## First Time Setup

The script will automatically install dependencies (pandoc and weasyprint) on first run.

Or run manually:
```bash
./setup.sh
```
